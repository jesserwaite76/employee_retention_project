Employee Retention Project
 - This is the capstone project from the Google Advanced Data Analytics certification course.

Problem
 - The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company.

Response
 - Analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

Impact
 - If we can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
